    <h2>What Caught My Attention</h2>
<p>In this assignment, I looked at three different websites. Two of them were good, and one was bad. The two websites that I looked at and thought were good was the Carroll College Website, and the Offical Montana State website. Both of the websites are very easy to navigate and are just fun to look at. It is easy access of both. One thing that I particulary liked was the background image on the Montana website. There a bunch of other images that are not back ground images, so it has different colors on the website, which I liked. The background image stays the whole time, and when you are scrolling through you can occasionally see the image. The thing I liked about the Carroll Website was the how there is almost a slide show of different pictures on the home page. Both are easy to navigate. And of course, I like the color on the home page, which is purple. Go Saints!</p>
<h2>The Coding </h2>
    <p> When I looked at the coding for the Montana website, it first looked like a different language to me. The first coding I saw was different than what I have done, and that is beacause it is much more advanced. It does, though, have links to the css pages, so I know what that is. There are spans and headers, as well as divs and hard references, so I understand that part of it. There are unordered lists as well as ordered lists and a bunch of different classes. The layout does not necessarily make sense to me, but that is because it is so advanced so I do not really know what I am looking for. I thinking that it is somewhat easy to navigate around in the coding page, it is just so confusing to me.
     </p>
<p>I thought that maybe I would be able to understand Carroll's html a little better but I was wrong. It starts with the same as I start mine, and as Montana started theirs, but then it looks much different. There are a bunch of different links to different things that I cannot even make a guess as to what it is or how to do it. There a bunch of random letters that make zero sense to me. The layout makes a little bit of sense to me but not a whole bunch. The html page is very confusing to me, again because it is way more complex than what I have done or what we have done in class. 
 </p>
<h2>Why I liked Them</h2>
<p> The main reason I liked these websites and chose them was because of their home page. It is very eye opening and catches your attention. With Carroll's there are so many different pictures and so many things are moving that I think it is cool, and would be really cool to know how to that. What caught my attention with Montana's is that it has one background image, and you can slide down on the page to find different things. It is simple yet complex. Which is why Montana was my favorite website. Also because I understood a little more of the coding from Montana's website. 
     </p>
    <h2>What I did not like</h2>
    <p>
    I was not really sure how to find a bad website, so I just looked it up on Google. And I found a website that, well, just is not good. It is called "Cloud 9 Walkers". It is a website for a business that sells horses out of Tennessee. There really is not a home page, you can just keep scrolling down and down and down. The back ground image image is the same, on repeat every time. There are different pictures of horses the further you scroll down, but there is no text on some of the pages, which is interesting. The colors are just different shades of blue, so it is not very appealing at all. The layout of the website makes no sense to me whatsoever, and is very hard to navigate. It is not well done at all. When I looked at the coding I understood to much of it, which is why it is a poor website. It is similar to the websites we have built in this class, so it is very basic. It repeats itself in the coding, and it shows on the website. I truly believe that everyone in CS 202 could build a better website if we put the time and effort into it. Which is why I think that all of our final projects will be much better and more detailed than this 'website'. Nothing about this website is very good or interesting. Which is why I picked it as my website that was 'poor'. Accept horses, I like horses.
