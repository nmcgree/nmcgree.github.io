    <h1>Winter</h1>

    <p>Winter is a very joyous time of the year. The snow begins to fall and it slowly inches closer to the end of the year. And with the end of the year brings holidays. Christmas and New Years are during the winter, but that is not the only thing to do during the winter. If you are interested in outdoors, downhill skiing is very fun. There is also cross country skiing, and ice skating. You can snow mobile and do many more activities! One of my favorite things to do is drive around and look at the Christmas lights, it might be the best timne of the year.
