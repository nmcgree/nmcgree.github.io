   Fall is one of the best tines of the year! If you are a football fan, there is football almost everyday! If you like to be outdoors, there are plenty of activities to do during fall. There is bow hunting, as well as rifle hunting in the fall. There are good spots to hunt all around Helena. Whether it is in the Elk Horns (special permit), or towards Great Falls. There are plenty of options. It is warm enough to still go fishing and go on hikes. And it is also the perfect time of the year to stay in and watch movies.
