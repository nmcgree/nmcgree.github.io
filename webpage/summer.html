   There are so many fun things to do in the summer! You can go to the lake, go camping, fishing, hiking, and much more! There are good fishing spots near Helena, as well as a couple of lakes. Water sports are personbally one of my favorite things to do. Another is sitting around a campfire late at night and looking up at clear, starry sky. The temperature usually gets pretty warm in the summer, so spend it outside! Be careful and remember to wear your sunscreen! Sunburns are no fun and very painful.
